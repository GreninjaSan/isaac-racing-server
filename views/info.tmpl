				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>When will Racing+ be officially released to the world?</h3>
				<p>I am working hard on it, and it will be released when it is finished.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>Are there any keyboard hotkeys?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><code>Alt + 1</code> &mdash; Focus the Isaac game window <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + 2</code> &mdash; Focus the Racing+ window <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + B</code> &mdash; Launch The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + E</code> &mdash; Create a new race.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + S</code> &mdash; Open the settings window.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + R</code> &mdash; Ready up for a race <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + F</code> &mdash; Finish a race (only in "Custom" races) <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + Q</code> &mdash; Quit the current race <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + L</code> &mdash; Return to the lobby.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + C</code> &mdash; Automatically type in BLCK CNDL and enter the game. (Must be at the character select screen.)</li>
					<li><code>Alt + V</code> &mdash; Automatically type in BLCK CNDL, paste in the seed, and enter the game. (Must be at the character select screen.)</li>

				<p>A <strong>(G)</strong> indicates a global hotkey &mdash; you can use global hotkeys even when Racing+ is not the active program.</p>

				<h3>What is the difference between ranked and unranked? What are seasons?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>In ranked play, unseeded races will count towards your average time and seeded races will count towards your TrueSkill rating. Both of these are tracked on separate leaderboards.</li>
					<li>To keep things fresh, the leaderboards will be reset after 3 months. This 3 month long period is called a "season". The ruleset will stay the same for the entire season.</li>
					<li>Season 1 is tentatively set to end on April 1st.</li>
					<li>Future seasons may have different rules than what is in place for season 1. This will help to keep Isaac racing fresh! You can discuss the kinds of rulesets that you want for subsequent seasons in the Isaac racing Discord server.</li>
				</ul>
