				<h2>Mod Changes</h2>
				<p>The Racing+ Lua mod fixes many bugs that remain unpatched in the vanilla game. It also introduces some balance changes. All of the changes <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mod/blob/master/CHANGES.md">are listed on GitHub</a>.</p>
				<p>You might also be interested in <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mod/blob/master/HISTORY.md">the version history of the mod</a>.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>When will Racing+ be officially released to the world?</h3>
				<p>I am working hard on it, and it will be released when it is finished.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>
					What are Easter Eggs?<br />
					How do I use the BLCK CNDL Easter Egg?
				</h3>
				<p>In Isaac, you can enable <a href="https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Seeds">various Easter Eggs</a> before starting a run. These Easter Eggs will alter your run in different ways. One of these is the "Total Curse Immunity" Easter Egg, which prevents all curses from appearing. Historically, most races have been done without curses, so Racing+ continues this tradition by ensuring that every player has this Easter Egg on before starting a race.</p>
				<p>
					Easter Eggs can be enabled by typing in a special seed at the character select screen before entering the game:<br />
					<code>Tab</code>
					<code>B</code>
					<code>L</code>
					<code>C</code>
					<code>K</code>
					<code>C</code>
					<code>N</code>
					<code>D</code>
					<code>L</code>
					<code>Enter</code>
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, you can use the helpful <code>Alt + C</code> hotkey to type all of this in for you automatically. This hotkey is not part of the mod itself, but it will work as long as you have the Racing+ client open.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, you have to type in this Easter Egg before every race. Due to limitations in the Afterbirth+ modding API, I can't actually make the mod automatically disable curses for you.
				</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>Are there any keyboard hotkeys?</h3>
				<p>Yes! A <strong>(G)</strong> indicates a global hotkey &mdash; you can use global hotkeys even when Racing+ is not the active program.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>Alt + 1</code> &mdash; Focus the Isaac game window <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + 2</code> &mdash; Focus the Racing+ window <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + B</code> &mdash; Launch The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + E</code> &mdash; Create a new race.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + S</code> &mdash; Open the settings window.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + R</code> &mdash; Ready up for a race <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + F</code> &mdash; Finish a race (only in "Custom" races) <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + Q</code> &mdash; Quit the current race <strong>(G)</strong>.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + L</code> &mdash; Return to the lobby.</li>
					<li><code>Alt + C</code> &mdash; Automatically type in BLCK CNDL. (Must be at the character select screen.)</li>
					<li><code>Alt + V</code> &mdash; Automatically type in BLCK CNDL and paste in the seed. (Must be at the character select screen.)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>
					What is the difference between ranked and unranked?<br />
					What are seasons?
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>In ranked play, unseeded races will count towards your average time and seeded races will count towards your TrueSkill rating. Both of these are tracked on separate leaderboards.</li>
					<li>To keep things fresh, the leaderboards will be reset after 3 months. This 3 month long period is called a "season". The ruleset will stay the same for the entire season.</li>
					<li>Season 1 is tentatively set to begin once the client is out of alpha.</li>
					<li>Future seasons may have different rules than what is in place for season 1. This will help to keep Isaac racing fresh! You can discuss the kinds of rulesets that you want for subsequent seasons in the Isaac racing Discord server.</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What does Racing+ do when it starts up?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It makes sure that the Racing+ mod exists in your mods directory.</li>
					<li>It makes sure that mods are enabled in your <code>options.ini</code> file.</li>
					<li>It makes sure that the Racing+ mod is the only mod enabled.</li>
					<li>It makes sure that you have at least one fully unlocked save file.</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>
					Is it possible to use Racing+ to race without any mods?<br />
					Is it possible to use Racing+ with a custom mod or mods?
				</h3>
				<p class="margin-half">
					Yes! First, note that Racing+ does several things when it starts up, as detailed in the previous question.<br />
					So, perform the following steps:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open the Racing+ program and make sure you are in the lobby.</li>
					<li>Go into the game's "Mods" menu and disable all mods (or enable only the custom mods that you want to play).</li>
					<li>Exit the game and reopen it, which ensures that all of the mods are loaded/unloaded correctly.</li>
					<li>On the Racing+ program, create a new race with a format of "Custom".</li>
					<li>Now, have your friends join the race. That's it!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remember to communicate to everyone in the race which mods are to be used and what the rules are.</p>

				<h3>Where does Racing+ get installed to?</h3>
				<p>The mod gets installed (via Steam) to:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\racing+_857628390</code></p>
				<p>The client gets installed to:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs</code></p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>How do I fix the bug where I start with an extra random item at the beginning of every run?</h3>
				<p>This doesn't have anything to do with Racing+. It is actually a bug with Eden's Blessing in the base game. To fix it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Disable all mods.</li>
					<li>Exit the game.</li>
					<li>Open the game.</li>
					<li>Enter a run with no easter eggs or seeds.</li>
					<li>Hold R to reset once.</li>
					<li>Go back to the main menu and re-enable mods.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After that, the bug should be fixed.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What do I do if the client won't let me click the "Ready" button, saying that I need to "hold R to reset the game"?</h3>
				<p>If you are resetting the game and the client is not detecting it, you probably have one of two problems.</p>
				<p><strong>#1)</strong> - Your Isaac installation could be corrupted. Open up your Isaac "log.txt" file, which is located here by default:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+\log.txt</code></p>
				<p>Search for the word "error". If you see something like this:</p>
				<p><pre>[INFO] - Running Lua Script: resources/scripts/main.lua
[INFO] - ERR: cannot open resources/scripts/main.lua: No such file or directory
[INFO] - There was an error running the lua file: resources/scripts/main.lua</pre></p>
				<p>This means that certain files are missing in your <code>resources</code> folder that are necessary for mods to run. Completely nuke your Isaac installation, ensure that all of the files are deleted, and then reinstall.</p>
				<p><strong>#2)</strong> - You could have multiple installations of Isaac on your computer and Racing+ is pointed at the wrong "log.txt" file. From the lobby, click the "Settings" button at the top. This will allow you to change the log file that the Racing+ client is pointed at.</p>
				<p>As a troubleshooting step, verify that you are looking at the right log file by starting a run, writing down the seed, opening up the "log.txt" file in Notepad, and searching to see if the game wrote the seed to the log file. If it didn't, then you need to find your real "log.txt" file and have Racing+ point to that one!</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What do I do if the mod doesn't seem to be working correctly in-game?</h3>
				<p>Sometimes, after an update, Steam can download a corrupted version of the mod. Nuke your Racing+ mod by deleting the mod directory located at:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods\racing+_857628390</code></p>
				<p>After deleting it, close Steam, reopen Steam, and then launch Isaac. The mod should then be automatically redownloaded.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>How do I change my username?</h3>
				<p>Once you sign up with a username, you can't change it. If you really, really need to change your username, contact an administrator.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>My favorite emote doesn't work in the chat. Can you add it?</h3>
				<p>Yes. Send it to an administrator on Discord.</p>
